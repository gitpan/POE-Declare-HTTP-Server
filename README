NAME
    POE::Declare::HTTP::Server - A simple HTTP server based on POE::Declare

SYNOPSIS
        # Create the web server
        my $server = POE::Declare::HTTP::Server->new(
            Hostname => '127.0.0.1',
            Port     => '8010',
            Handler  => sub {
                my $request  = shift;
                my $response = shift;
        
            # Your webby stuff here...
        
            return;
            },
        );
        
    # Control with methods
        $server->start;
        $server->stop;

DESCRIPTION
    This module allows creation of a simple HTTP server based on
    POE::Declare.

METHODS
  new
        my $server = POE::Declare::HTTP::Server->new(
            Hostname => '127.0.0.1',
            Port     => '8010',
            Handler  => \&content,
        );

    The "new" constructor sets up a reusable HTTP server that can be enabled
    and disabled repeatedly as needed.

    It takes three required parameters parameters. "Hostname", "Port" and
    "Handler".

    The "Handler" parameter should be a "CODE" reference that will be passed
    a HTTP::Request object and a HTTP::Response object. Your code should
    examine the request object, and fill the provided response object.

  Hostname
    The "Hostname" accessor returns the server to bind to, as originally
    provided to the constructor.

  Port
    The "Port" accessor returns the port number to bind to, as originally
    provided to the constructor.

  Handler
    The "Handler" accessor returns the "CODE" reference that requests will
    be passed to, as provided to the constructor.

  start
    The "start" method enables the web server. If the server is already
    running, this method will shortcut and do nothing.

    If called before POE has been started, the web server will start
    immediately once POE is running.

  stop
    The "stop" method disables the web server. If the server is not running,
    this method will shortcut and do nothing.
